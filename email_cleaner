#I was doing some email web scraping and periods at the end of the email kept getting scraped with them so I created this snipped to clean the emails. Cheers!

import pandas as pd

#rad in a cscv file of dirty emails
df = pd.read_csv("emails_dirty.csv")
original_df = pd.read_csv("emails_dirty.csv")

#loop through each email and remove the period if it has one
for email in df["Email"]:
    if email[-1] == '.':
        length = len(email)
        email = email[:(length - 1)]
        print(email)
        df.loc[df["Email"] == email] = email

#write the cleaned list of emails to a new csv
original_df['Email'] = df['Email']
original_df.to_csv('emails_clean.csv', encoding='utf-8', index=False)
